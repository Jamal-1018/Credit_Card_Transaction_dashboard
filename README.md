## Project Objective:
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly transactions dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, which enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively towards business growth.

The credit card customers dataset has all the variables that are related to the demographic metrics of the customer, geographic metrics of the customer, marital status, and financial status of the customer to get the insights that are understandable in the trends of the revenue, to get the positive impact on the business growth. 

## Process:
- Initially, we imported the data from the MySQL server to the PowerBI
- We have created new variables based on the analysis using DAX(Data Analysis Expression) queries to our tables
- We used multiple visualizations like stacked bar charts, line charts, cards, tree maps, pie charts, and slicers as per our requirements to extract the insights of the data.
